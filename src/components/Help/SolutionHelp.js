    <h2>What is the correct solution block?</h2>
    <p>
        The correct solution block is a fully working example that validates properly. Depending on
        <br />
        what type of technique you pick to categorize your kata, the solution may be just
        <br />
        one of many ways to solve the kata. In the case of a bug fix kata, your solution
        <br />
        will probably be the most obvious solution for fixing the code.
    </p>
    <h2>How do I validate that the solution is correct?</h2>
    <p>
        You can use the test fixture editor to create the code that will validate both
        <br />
        your solution and also the solution that other code warriors (users) come up with. Check
        <br />
        out the test fixture help tab for more details on writing test fixtures.
    </p>
    <h2>What is the "Solution Setup" for?</h2>
    <p>
        The solution setup is what a code warrior will first see when they
        attempt to solve your kata. Its the boiler plate code for the kata
        that helps set the stage. If you are creating a bug fix kata then the code
        <br />
        will be the invalid version that a code warrior will need to fix. If you are
        <br />
        creating an algorithm or reference kata then the solution setup may just be an empty function
        <br />
        with some comments to help get them started. If you are creating a refactoring
        <br />
        kata then the code will possibly be a big hunk of messy code that should be refactored
        <br />
        so that it uses a cleaner API that the test fixture will test against.
        <br />
    </p>
    <h2>What is the "Preloaded" code for?</h2>
    <p>
        This is code that will be loaded before the solution code within the execution path.
